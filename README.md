# Image Processing Suite

This is a production-ready, modular, and extensible image processing application with AI-powered features.

## Features
- Image format conversion
- AI image generation (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek)
- Image enhancement (filters, super-resolution, etc.)
- Background removal (local and API)
- Batch processing
- Advanced tools (analysis, custom filters, resize/crop)

## Project Structure
- `src/` — Core application modules (UI, processing, utils)
- `config/` — Configuration files (env, logging)
- `tests/` — Unit and integration tests
- `scripts/` — Deployment, Docker, and utility scripts
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `app.py` — Entrypoint (will be refactored)

## Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in `config/` (see `.env.example`).
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python app.py`

## Deployment
- Docker and cloud deployment scripts included in `scripts/`.

## Security
- API keys and secrets are managed via environment variables.

## Testing
- Run tests with `pytest` from the root directory.
